Welcome to **evsystem.in**! Your GitHub sponsorship goes directly to our Open Collective fund. Our goal is to secure funding for core team members around the world to help EV-Charging (Open Charge Point Protocol) ship more frequent and more innovative releases.

We're a team of distributed volunteers around the world working on all aspects of EV-Charging The core project, documentation, icons, and more. Keeping up-to-date with bug reports, feature requests, and more is time-consuming and often difficult. We'd like to continue to support and incentivize our core team, while also allowing us to expand into recruiting new full-time maintainers.

## Summary

The EV charging industry is rapidly growing, and the Charging Station Management System (CSMS) plays a vital role in managing electric vehicle charging stations. There are several features that are commonly included in a CSMS, including station monitoring, billing and payment, reservation and scheduling, remote access, reporting and analytics, integration with other systems, user authentication and access control, remote firmware updates, and customer support. As the demand for EV charging stations increases, many technology companies are developing innovative solutions to improve the performance and efficiency of CSMS. Therefore, there are plenty of opportunities for companies to contribute their technologies to the development of the EV charging industry and enhance the user experience for EV drivers.
